# MeasureStream – Overview

## Purpose
MeasureStream is a modular and scalable platform designed to manage
distributed sensor networks, with a focus on industrial LoRa-based deployments.

The platform handles sensor configuration, data ingestion, calibration,
and visualization through a microservices architecture.

## Main Use Cases
- Register and manage sensor nodes
- Collect measurements from distributed sensors
- Apply calibration and configuration settings
- Visualize time-series data through Grafana dashboards
- Secure access using centralized authentication

## Key Characteristics
- Microservices-based architecture
- Event-driven communication using Apache Kafka
- Polyglot persistence (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Web-based frontend for management and visualization

## High-Level Components
- Sensor Nodes (LoRa)
- Backend Microservices
- Message Broker (Kafka)
- Databases
- Web Frontend
- Monitoring and Visualization Stack

## Target Users
- System administrators
- Developers extending the platform
- Researchers and students
